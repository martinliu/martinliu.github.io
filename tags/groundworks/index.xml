It is talking about OpenNMS, Zabix, Zenoss, GroundWorks and Hyperic, those might b the hottest projects around NMS field.

>Open Management Consortium.&lt;/a>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sometimes, people might spend too much time on testing different projects; I know this is a kind of fun. But eventually they only got lots of comments about manny project. They still did not realize the value of open source. The best way to adpat open source is that you just pick one nice project and keeping to use it for months at least. I have a net admin frind who I had since helped to setup Cacti for all of his network devices. He don&amp;rsquo;t know so many NSM projects, but he really engoy Cacti. With Cacti, he can do a easier and better job then before. So, are you going to still watching open source world? Let&amp;rsquo;s get start your real open source journey.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
