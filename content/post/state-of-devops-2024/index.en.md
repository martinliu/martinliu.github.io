## Executive Summary

DORA has been investigating the capabilities, practices, and measures of high-performing technology-driven teams and organizations for over a decade. This is our tenth DORA report. We have heard from more than 39,000 professionals working at organizations of every size and across many different industries globally. Thank you for joining us along this journey and being an important part of the research!

DORA collects data through an annual, worldwide survey of professionals working in technical and adjacent roles. The survey includes questions related to ways of working and accomplishments that are relevant across an organization and to the people working in that organization.

DORA uses rigorous statistical evaluation methodology to understand the relationships between these factors and how they each contribute to the success of teams and organizations.

This year, we augmented our survey with in-depth interviews of professionals as a way to get deeper insights, triangulate, and provide additional context for our findings. See the Methodology chapter for more details.


The key accomplishments and outcomes we investigated this year are:

* **Reducing burnout**: Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged or excessive stress, often characterized by feelings of cynicism, detachment, and a lack of accomplishment.

* **Organizational performance**: This measures an organization's performance in areas including profitability, market share, total customers, operating efficiency, customer satisfaction, quality of products and services, and its ability to achieve goals.

* **Flow**: Flow measures how much focus a person tends to achieve during development tasks.

* **Job satisfaction**: Job satisfaction measures someone’s overall feeling about their job.

* **Product performance**: This measures the usability, functionality, value, availability, performance (for example, latency), and security of a product.

* **Productivity**: Productivity measures the extent to which an individual feels effective and efficient in their work, creating value and achieving tasks.

* **Team performance**: This measures a team's ability to collaborate, innovate, work efficiently, rely on each other, and adapt.

### Key findings

**AI is having broad impact**

AI is producing a paradigm shift in the field of software development. Early adoption is showing some promising results, tempered by caution.

AI adoption benefits:

* Flow
* Productivity
* Job satisfaction
* Code quality
* Internal documentation
* Review processes
* Team performance
* Organizational performance



However, AI adoption also brings some detrimental effects. We have observed reductions to software delivery performance, and the effect on product performance is uncertain. Additionally, individuals are reporting a decrease in the amount of time they spend doing valuable work as AI adoption increases, a curious finding that is explored more later in this report.

Teams should continue experimenting and learning more about the impact of increasing reliance on AI.

### AI adoption increases as trust in AI increases

Using generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) makes developers feel more productive, and developers who trust gen AI use it more. There is room for improvement in this area: 39.2% of respondents reported having little or no trust in AI.

### User-centricity drives performance

Organizations that prioritize the end user experience produce higher quality products, with developers who are more productive, satisfied, and less likely to experience burnout.

### Transformational leadership matters

Transformational leadership improves employee productivity, job satisfaction, team performance, product performance, and organizational performance while also helping decrease employee burnout.

### Stable priorities boost productivity and well-being

Unstable organizational priorities lead to meaningful decreases in productivity and substantial increases in burnout, even when organizations have strong leaders, good internal documents, and a user-centric approach to software development.

### Platform engineering can boost productivity

Platform engineering has a positive impact on productivity and organizational performance, but there are some cautionary signals for software delivery performance.

### Cloud enables infrastructure flexibility

Flexible infrastructure can increase organizational performance. However, moving to the cloud without adopting the flexibility that cloud has to offer may be more harmful than remaining in the data center. Transforming approaches, processes, and technologies is required for a successful migration.

### High levels of software delivery performance are achievable

The highest performing teams excel across all four software delivery metrics (change lead time, deployment frequency, change fail percentage, and failed deployment recovery time) while the lowest performers perform poorly across all four. We see teams from every industry vertical in each of the performance clusters.


### Applying insights from DORA

Driving team and organizational improvements with DORA requires that you assess how you're doing today, identify areas to invest and make improvements, and have feedback loops to tell you how you're progressing. Teams that adopt a mindset and practice of continuous improvement are likely to see the most benefits. Invest in building the organizational muscles required to repeat this over time.

Findings from our research can help inform your own experiments and hypotheses. It's important to experiment and measure the impact of your changes to see what works best for your team and organization. Doing so will help you validate our findings. Expect your results to differ and please share your progress so that we all may learn from your experience.

We recommend taking an experimental approach to improvement.

1. Identify an area or outcome you would like to improve.
2. Measure your baseline or current state.
3. Develop a set of hypotheses about what might get you closer to your desired state.
4. Agree and commit to a plan for improvement.
5. Do the work.
6. Measure the progress you’ve made.
7. Repeat the process.

Improvement work is achieved iteratively and incrementally.
