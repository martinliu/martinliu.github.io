This document helps you set up a simplified lab to review hardware-accelerated GPU virtualization for  Windows desktop VDI workloads on Citrix XenServer. True GPU virtualization (a.k.a vGPU) on NVIDIA GRID  cards is supported since Service Pack 1 of Citrix XenServer 6.2. It extends high-performance GPU sharing capabilities beyond Windows Server RDS workloads, that we cover in part 1 and part 2 of this series of Guides; Part 3 walks through the following topics:
