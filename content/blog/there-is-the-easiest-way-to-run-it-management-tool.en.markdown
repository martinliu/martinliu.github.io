If you are not a Linux guru, windows is the OS you can use only. It does not matter. You could easily try it on your Windows Laptop probably. Since VMware Player is free for using, and there are lots of VMware applications on the internet. So, you just download whatever you need and run them on everywhere. Then you get a fancy IT management solution running on your computer; you really do not even know about Linux and open source. You will see it rocks for you; you won’t troubleshoot for installation issues.<br />
