As I have seen a lot, traveled the world, assisted a wealth of customers with numerous ITSM and bespoke applications, have a breath of experience that most “Stable” Remedy developers do not have.

What planet is your client from? I would think most consultants would be glad to MILK a project for ALL its worth. But that would be bad business for the employer. So projects tend to adhere to budgeting constraints.It is not the consultant’s fault that many Remedy projects end on or ahead of schedule. Unless he/she has worked TOO hard.

Time and again I have come across employing interviewers question me about the implementation of ITIL as if it were a physical product. Its nothing new.Yes not so hard to update a resume to make it like you were on a &lsquo;stable&rsquo; job and not a &lsquo;job hopper&rsquo;. Technically if I were to do that, it would look like I worked for just 2 companies over the 12 years I have worked with Remedy. I had to do just quite the opposite when I started looking for consulting gigs, and name every customer my old company had as a different project so that it would look more like a &lsquo;job hoppers&rsquo; resume.Its just a wrapping paper. At the end of the day you are the real stuff - what you know or do not, and can do or cannot, makes the difference to a smart employer (if they exist).Joe&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-8&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;Did you notice the slight jab at the end of the note?

It drives me crazy that there is such a disconnect between the hiring manager and the HR team in most companies.One of my favorite job adverts had the perfect candidate as being aged 21 – 25, Bachelors degree and 6+ years experience in a corporate environment.

If you&rsquo;re looking for a contract, go for Iraq before Afghan. They&rsquo;re trying to pay people the same amount of money for both places. Left Iraq 6 weeks ago. No way I&rsquo;d go to Afghan for the same pay. (Living conditions are worse, more time off to sit around and do nothing(very boring), and we got almost no incoming at Victory in Baghdad.)As far as the Iraq posting. It says ARS 6.3 but that description is 4 years old. It&rsquo;s 7.1, ITSM 7.0.3. 7.5 is probably never going to happen there. But if you you&rsquo;re looking for a new contract and want to get paid pretty good to learn ITSM 7 and get some experience with 7.1 (that&rsquo;s why I went) then send Jeff Glasser your resume.Jason BessRemedy Developer/ConsultantBess Development Corporation(My position is the one they&rsquo;re back-filling in Iraq right now.

As I have seen a lot, traveled the world, assisted a wealth of customers with numerous ITSM and bespoke applications, have a breath of experience that most “Stable” Remedy developers do not have.

What planet is your client from? I would think most consultants would be glad to MILK a project for ALL its worth. But that would be bad business for the employer. So projects tend to adhere to budgeting constraints.It is not the consultant’s fault that many Remedy projects end on or ahead of schedule. Unless he/she has worked TOO hard. Apparently your client does not want THAT GUY.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;4&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As my last &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; job was for an &ldquo;<em>UN</em>Stable&rdquo; company that <em>Disappeared</em> one month end of last year,I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better myself&mldr;spot on Doug!Happy Holidays To You and Yours!&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;5&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Read between the lines dudes :-)We need a Lead Remedy developer who has the experience of a junior/trainee Remedy Administrator, and who is willing to work at the wages of a gas station attendant..

I think that it’s funny though that some employers do not realize anything about this product or the way that it is developed or administered. But I guess that is what recruiters are actually for right?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;7&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Hey Tommy,We just like to have harmless fun sometimes :-) We know (at least most of us) Josh for a while as well as the fact that recruiters / employers sometimes have no clue what they are talking about. Time and again I have come across employing interviewers question me about the implementation of ITIL as if it were a physical product. Its nothing new.Yes not so hard to update a resume to make it like you were on a &lsquo;stable&rsquo; job and not a &lsquo;job hopper&rsquo;. Technically if I were to do that, it would look like I worked for just 2 companies over the 12 years I have worked with Remedy. I had to do just quite the opposite when I started looking for consulting gigs, and name every customer my old company had as a different project so that it would look more like a &lsquo;job hoppers&rsquo; resume.Its just a wrapping paper. At the end of the day you are the real stuff - what you know or do not, and can do or cannot, makes the difference to a smart employer (if they exist).Joe&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-8&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;Did you notice the slight jab at the end of the note? I just wanted to get in a shot. It drives me crazy that there is such a disconnect between the hiring manager and the HR team in most companies.One of my favorite job adverts had the perfect candidate as being aged 21 – 25, Bachelors degree and 6+ years experience in a corporate environment. The math just didn’t add up unless you started your degree plan at before you were 13.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;9&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-As recruiters who have filled numerous Remedy positions in IRAQ and elsewhere we have tried to always be responsive to the needs of the client and the realities of the talent pool. The external recruiter&rsquo;s role does not stop with the resume.With respect to the current thread, there is a real clue re the client&rsquo;s mind set and/or lack thereof, when they use the word &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; in their job description.

If you&rsquo;re looking for a contract, go for Iraq before Afghan. They&rsquo;re trying to pay people the same amount of money for both places. Left Iraq 6 weeks ago. No way I&rsquo;d go to Afghan for the same pay. (Living conditions are worse, more time off to sit around and do nothing(very boring), and we got almost no incoming at Victory in Baghdad.)As far as the Iraq posting. It says ARS 6.3 but that description is 4 years old. It&rsquo;s 7.1, ITSM 7.0.3. 7.5 is probably never going to happen there. But if you you&rsquo;re looking for a new contract and want to get paid pretty good to learn ITSM 7 and get some experience with 7.1 (that&rsquo;s why I went) then send Jeff Glasser your resume.Jason BessRemedy Developer/ConsultantBess Development Corporation(My position is the one they&rsquo;re back-filling in Iraq right now.
